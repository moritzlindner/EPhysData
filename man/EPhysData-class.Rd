\title{EPhysData - Class for Electrophysiological Data}
\value{
An object of class \code{EPhysData}
}
\description{
This class represents the most fundamental unit of electrophysiological data acquisition, typically obtained in response to a one single type of stimulus. It includes data (trials in columns), time and stimulus traces, units, as well as information on post-processing steps (such as filtering and averaging) that can be applied to the data.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{Data}}{A 2D array representing the  electrophysiological data. trials (i.e. linked data with a common time basis, like repeated measurements) are represented by columns. Trials may be equivalent to “segments”, “episodes”, “runs”, “recordings”, depending on the nature of the data.}

\item{\code{TimeTrace}}{A numeric vector containing the time trace of the electrophysiological data.}

\item{\code{StimulusTrace}}{A numeric vector containing the stimulus trace (optional).}

\item{\code{Created}}{A POSIXct object representing the creation date and time of the object.}

\item{\code{Rejected}}{A logical vector indicating which trials to exclude from averaging.}

\item{\code{filter.fx}}{A function that can be applied to each segment. By default, it leaves the data unchanged.}

\item{\code{average.fx}}{A function describing how averaging across trials should be performed. By default, each segment is returned and no averaging is performed.}
