This file contains electrophysiological data. 
Data : A 2D array representing the electrophysiological data with columns for repeated measurements
DataUnit : The SI unit of the Data
TimeTrace : A numeric vector containing the time trace of the electrophysiological data.
TimeUnit : The SI unit of the TimeTrace
StimulusTrace : A numeric vector containing the stimulus trace (optional).
StimulusUnit : The SI unit of the StimulusTrace
Created : A POSIXct object representing the creation date and time of the object.
Rejected : A logical vector indicating which repeated measurements to exclude from averaging.
filter.fx : A function that can be applied to each repeated measurement By default, it leaves the data unchanged.
average.fx : A function describing how averaging across repeated measurement should be performed. By default, repeated measurements are returned and no averaging is performed.
